title: About me
---

I'm a researcher at the Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany. My research interests are visual place recognition under appearance changes, machine learning, and mobile robotics -- please refer to the [list of my publications](/publications/) to get an overview of my research activities. With these techniques, I strive to enable mobile systems, such as robots and cars, to act autonomously over a long period of time despite severe appearance changes due to dynamic objects, the time of day, the day-night cycle, changing weather, or seasons.
